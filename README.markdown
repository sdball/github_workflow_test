Github Workflow
===============

Start a new feature
-------------------

    git branch --track feature_name origin/master

`--track` tells git to setup a remotely tracked branch

Branching from `origin/master` means we don't have to remember to update our
local copy of the master branch to ensure we are working on the latest code.

Starting a pull request for feature discussion and review
---------------------------------------------------------

1. With at least one commit in the feature, go to github and start pull request
   from feature_name to master.

Merging a pull request
----------------------

### Automatic

github.
